        <h2>Jimi Hendrix</h2>
        <p>James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music".[1]

Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith, who in turn interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager.[2] Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: "Hey Joe", "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary". He achieved fame in the U.S. after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the U.S.; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27.

<h4>Austin Ellis</h4>
<p>

By the time Austin got asked by NBC in 2014 to be on Season 6 of The Voice, he had already written and produced two studio albums by himself before deciding to audition. Austin, after being chosen by Maroon 5's Adam Levine during the blind auditions, was partnered with Josh Kaufman to create one of the season's most memorable moments by singing the hit "Happy" by Pharell Williams. The training and coaching Austin received during his experience on the show has taken his talent and career to an even higher level!

Raised on equal doses of Soul and Rock, Austin earned a degree in Songwriting and Music Business from the nation's top Entertainment Industry Program at Middle Tennessee State University in Nashville, TN. Hailing from North Beach, Maryland, Austin has toured the US, Europe, and Australia and performs more than 200 shows per year.

Austin captivates listeners with his powerful voice and by his warm acoustic style. Influenced by the soulful delivery of John Legend and laid back strumming of Jack Johnson, Austin Ellis invites audiences to relax and enjoy the music.
